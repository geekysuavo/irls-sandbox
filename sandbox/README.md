This directory contains all task management code. Aside from some common
code, each source file implements the task generator and task action for
a specific task (or group of tasks).

Common code:

* `util.py`: Definitions of experiments, solvers, _etc._

Task-related code:

* `eigen.py`: Download and unpack [eigen3](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org)
* `solvers.py`: Compile all implemented algorithms
