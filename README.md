# The IRLS sandbox

A safe place to play with _iteratively reweighted least squares_ (IRLS),
and _variationally reweighted least squares_ (VRLS), with a specific
emphasis on reconstructing nonuniformly sampled (NUS)
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) datasets.

Technical details of the algorithms are in preparation for submission to:

> Worley, B., _Variationally reweighted least squares for
> sparse recovery_, Journal of Magnetic Resonance, 2019.
