# The IRLS sandbox

A safe place to play with _iteratively reweighted least squares_ (IRLS),
and _variationally reweighted least squares_ (VRLS), with a specific
emphasis on reconstructing _nonuniformly sampled_ (NUS)
_nuclear magnetic resonance_ (NMR) datasets.

Technical details of the algorithms are _in preparation for submission to_:

> Worley, B., _Variationally reweighted least squares for
> sparse recovery_, Journal of Magnetic Resonance, 2019.
